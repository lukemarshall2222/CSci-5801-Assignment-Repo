Use Case 1: Interactive Data Processing

Actor: System Tester
Type: Primary
Description: The system tester opens Loafr and applies filters to view errors from the patient
some component during a specific time window. The tester notices messages are dealyed from events and 
uses the search functionality to find all instances where response time exceeds some 
threshold. The tester exports the filtered dataset for review with the development team.

Actor: System Tester
Type: Failure
Description: The system tester ties to load a log file from a component with logging that was not 
updated to conform to the standardized format. Loafr detects the non-conforming 
format, rejects it, and displays an error message indicating which formatting requirements are not met.


Use Case 2: Query Data

Actor: System Tester
Type: Primary
Description: The system tester wants to investigate an issue where some component
performs its function incorrectly. The tester queries the data using Loafr to find all 
log entries where the component's logged values for the misbehaving portion are outside the expected 
range during the past month's testing. Loafr executes the query and presents 
the results in a tabular view, highlighting potential relationships. The tester saves this 
query for use in regression testing when exploring possible solutions.

Actor: System Tester
Type: Failure
Description: The system tester attempts to run a query on some data set. The query is not allowed 
by the API for some syntactic reason e.g. misspelling, wrong number of arguments, unrecognized 
keywords. Loafr rejects the query and reports the specific issue to the user along with possible
solutions.
