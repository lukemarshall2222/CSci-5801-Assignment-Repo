As a launch engineer, I want a system that is easy to use and prevents launch until the user is at the control unit and has validated the launch systems. I want an easy format for tracking the progress of the launch, for ensuring a proper safety checklist is followed, and for consistently launching the rocket according to a safe proceedure.
