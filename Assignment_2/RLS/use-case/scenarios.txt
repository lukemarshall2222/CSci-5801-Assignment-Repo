Use Case 1: Launch Rocket

Actor: Launch Engineer
Type: Primary
Description: The launch engineer tests the launch pad systems and readys the rocket for launch. 
Once the systems are confirmed ready, the launch engineer leaves to a safe distance where the 
control unit is located. The launch engineer pushes the ready button to ensure systems are set up. 
The launch engineer then pushes launch when confirmation is received.

Actor: Launch Engineer
Type: Failure
Description: The launch engineer tests the launch pad systems, but the battery is dead. In this case, 
the test button fails to provide adequate power to the ignition system to meet a functionality 
threshold. The system does not acknowledge a passed test and does not enable the control unit, 
indicating the test failed.


Use Case 2: Observe Launch

Actor: Rocket Designer
Type: Primary
Description: The rocket designer hands the rocket off to the launch engineer and provides any 
necessary specifications. The rocket designer then watches with the audience as the rocket launch 
is commenced and the system ensures the rocket matches to the specifications of the rocket.

Actor: Observer
Type: Secondary
Description: The observer sees the status of the system and is informed of whether the launch is 
imminent or not. If launch is imminent, indication is given to observers to leave the launch area 
and stand at a safe distance for launch.
